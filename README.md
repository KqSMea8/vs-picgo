# vs-picgo(Vscode Plugin for PicGo)

> The VSCode extension of [PicGo](https://github.com/PicGo)

## OverView

`vs-picgo` is a VSCode extension to upload images to a remote image hosting and insert the url into current active MarkDown file. It's more efficient. And it can give us a better experience of uploading images. `vs-picgo` supports 8 kinds of image hostings supported by [PicGo](https://github.com/PicGo).

- Uploading an image from clipboard

## Settings

- out of box
	* We could use `vs-picgo` without any setting.
	* The default image hosting is [SM.MS](https://sm.ms/).
- custom
	* insert the content below into `usersetting.json` of VSCode. [Detail information about custom setting](https://picgo.github.io/PicGo-Core-Doc/zh/guide/config.html#%E9%BB%98%E8%AE%A4%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6)

**NOTE: picgo.path is prior to picBed, which means if picgo.path is not empty string, vs-picgo will use the configuration file defined by picogo.path.**

```js
{
  "picgo": {
    "path": "" // path to your external configure file, default value is "", which means that vs-picgo will use "picBed" info below. External configure file should be a JSON file containing all the "picBed" info below.,
    "logPath": ""  // path to the json log file which records all uploaded images, default to your_home_dir/vs-picgo-log.json
  },
  "picBed": {
